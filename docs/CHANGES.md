v1.0.2 - Patch 2 - Reorganized file structure, combined all alarm relevant functions into the file alarms.py, renamed serverclientsocket.py to sockets.py, fixed file path issues: now using os.path, made some changes in the way server.py works, modified some Alarms class functions, client.py no longer saves to alarms.json file, considering removing all file usage from client.py, created notes.txt to organize future feature implementation and issues.

v1.0.1 - Patch 1 - Fixed typefield issues, typos, etc.

v1.0.0 - Initial Release - Hellish, nightmarish, sloppy, chaos...but it works.
